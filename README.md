# Nginx Reverse Proxy with Gilbn Dark Theme
This is a selection of reverse proxy configurations for Nginx, specifically for a media-server docker software stack. These proxyconf's are configured to use [Gilbn](https://github.com/gilbN/theme.park)'s Dark Theme, if there was one available at the time.  

These were assembled for personal usage, but I also support the further enhancement of the "Suitarr" set of applications (Sonarr, Radarr, Lidarr, Bazarr, etc) and their associated media-server software apps. These are provided to be used at your own risk and your own support.
