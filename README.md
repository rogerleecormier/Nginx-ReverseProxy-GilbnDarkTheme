# Nginx Reverse Proxy with Gilbn Dark Theme
This is a selection of reverse proxy subdomain configurations for Nginx, specifically for a media-server docker software stack. These proxyconf's are configured to use [Gilbn](https://github.com/gilbN/theme.park)'s Dark Theme, if there was one available at the time.  

These were assembled for personal usage, but I also support the further enhancement of the "Suitarr" set of applications (Sonarr, Radarr, Lidarr, Bazarr, etc) and their associated media-server software apps. These are provided to be used at your own risk and your own support.

Currently, the following have been tested and used, and are provided in this repository:
* [bazarr.subdomain.conf](/Proxy-Confs/bazarr.subdomain.conf)
* [filebrowser.subdomain.conf](/Proxy-Confs/filebrowser.subdomain.conf)
* [jackett.subdomain.conf](/Proxy-Confs/jackett.subdomain.conf)
* [lidarr.subdomain.conf](/Proxy-Confs/lidarr.subdomain.conf)
